            AI is taking over. See <a href="#why">why</a> it is and <a href="#how">how</a> we can stop it.
        </p>
        <p id="why">
            AI (Or artificial intelligence) is basically a robot that knows almost anything - Even 
            illegal things, with a bit of jiggery-pokery. It can tell you anything, can create anything, 
            and can do it even better than a human. Now, this isn't something to hide in your house about… 
            at least not yet. As of mid-2023, AI LLMs (Large Language Models like ChatGPT) and Robots 
            have not been fused together. But as time goes on, it is almost guaranteed that it will 
            happen, creating dark realities currently only in books like Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson. 
            There are three ways this can go: The dark way, The copilot way, and the anti-ai way. 
            The dark way is that it takes over, and we have to fight for our lives. The copilot way, is 
            that the AI is a copilot for people's jobs, not taking over. The Anti-AI way is that AI is 
            illegal, and eventually becomes an urban tale.
        </p>
        <p id="how">
            But how do we stop the dark way from happening? Well, there are a few ways. Way 1: People 
            sue ChatGPT and all of the other models, and also sue their creators for fueling a generation
            of cheating in essays and assessments, and having jobs being replaced by AI. Way 2: We sign a 
            <a onclick="petition.showModal()">petiton</a> to stop AI. Way 3: Well, we just stop using it
            making sure there is no reason for AI. Now don't get me wrong, it's good for some things. But
            for other things, like cheating and replacing jobs - That's where it crosses the line. Join now,
            before it's too late.
